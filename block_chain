Blockchain uses a combination of cryptography and consensus building protocols to enable systems of decentralised trust.
-------------------------------------------------
Public vs Private Blockchains
A public blockchain allows all users to both write and read to the transactional record. Bitcoin is an example of a blockchain powered public ledger. A private blockchain allows only trusted and authenticated users to write or read. The trust mechanisms could be legal contracts between companies.
-------------------------------------------------
Blockchain Use Cases
Smart Contracts - Blockchain can help companies to enforce contracts with customers and other third parties.

Online Identity Management -Rights management for music/video is an example where Blockchain can help create scalable, distributed identity resolution as opposed to risky, centralized trust mechanisms that are vulnerable to hacking.

Medical Records - Blockchain can help create secure, globally available medical records that cut across healthcare providers.

Asset management - Blockchain can enable better ways to manage asset ownership, like land records or share trades.
-------------------------------------------------
Blockchain is a distributed transactional ledger that was originally created to enable cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin

Its design enables decentralized trust mechanisms that now see use cases in financial services, healthcare, education and legal services
-------------------------------------------------
It is :

Distributed transactional store

Replicates across multiple systems in near real time

Uses cryptography & digital signatures to establish identity & authenticity

Has mechanisms that make it very hard to change historical record
