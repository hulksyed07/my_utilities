Design process can be said to comprise of 7 stages:

  1 Define
  2 Research
  3 Ideate
  4 Prototype
  5 Select
  6 Implement 
  7 Learn

Industry grade design methodologies are:
4D UX Methodology
Double Diamond Model
Bootcamp Bootleg

The five W's
The design brief gives the team an idea of what is to be achieved. The Five Ws will provide answers that are required to define a design job adequately. The Five Ws of design thinking are: Who, What, When, Where and Why.

Who is the client and target audience? (size, culture, characteristics)
What design solution is the client thinking of? (print, web, video)
When will the design be needed and for how long? (project timescales)
Where will the design be used? (media, location, country)
Why does the client think a design solution is required?
--------------------------------------------------
Primary research involves getting direct feedback from clients/users.
Secondary research is the information you obtain from general secondary sources like consumer market research reports.

--------------------------------------------------
4D uX methodology
The phases are:

Discover – understanding the problem(s) and developing insights
Design – the area to focus upon
Develop – potential solutions to the problem(s)
Deliver - solutions that work

--------------------------------------------------

Discovery Phase

This is the phase where we do extensive research on our target users, understanding their pain points, observing the environment in which they work and developing insights.

Here's an illustration of how discovery phase takes place in a web design process

Requirements and Specifications: The complete set of specifications and functionality of the project is captured here. Once we have the specs clear, we may proceed to further steps.
Sitemap: A sitemap is a high level diagram portraying the general structure and architecture of the website. The objective for a sitemap is to be able to clearly identify the pages, various sections and navigation items that will make up the site.

--------------------------------------------------

Design Phase

This is the phase where we actually start to design page by page. Here, we design interactions, interface elements and also the visual aesthetics of the pages.

Here's an illustration of how design phase takes place in a web design process

Wireframe: Here, we begin by sketching out the general layout of a page, which could also be in the form of paper sketches. A wireframe is simply a black and white model showing the overall placement of the elements on the page. This is the step that decides where the main navigation will go, where the logo will be placed as well as all images, text and media elements.
Visual Design: At this stage, we implement our creative ideas and we begin to design the look and feel of the website. During this phase, we should be to capture the essence of the client's business; its culture as well as the products and services.

Double Diamond Design methodology

Converging thinking and Diverging thinking

-----------------------------------------------
Bootcamp Bootleg

Proposed by Stanford d. school, this methodology is one of the wholly defined methodologies that is very complete and recommended for complex design works.

Empathy is key here in this 5 stage process. These are

  1 Empathize
  2 Define
  3 Ideate
  4 Prototype
  5 Test
