place it at /opt/oracle

Now run the below command:


Edit the bashrc to add the paths:

vi ~/.bashrc

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/Oracle/usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client/lib"
export ORACLE_HOME="/opt/Oracle/usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client"

cd /opt/Oracle/usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client/lib
     ln -s libclntsh.so.12.1 libclntsh.so
     
This is to resolve the below error:

Error Message:
  Could not compile with Oracle instant client.
  /opt/Oracle/usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client/lib/libclntsh.so could not be found.
  You may need to make a symbolic link.
     cd /opt/Oracle/usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client/lib
     ln -s libclntsh.so.12.1 libclntsh.so
     
In case you get error due to missing sdk then download the sdk from oracles' website and place it inside the lib folder:
/opt/Oracle/usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client/lib
