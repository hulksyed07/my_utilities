Paid Search
Paid Search is about bidding and buying keywords for which your product's/ services' search results will appear right at the top of a search engine’s results page as a “sponsored link”.

On top of Paid Search, Search Engine Optimization ensures that your products and services are featured prominently in other relevant search situations.

Examples:
Google Answer Box

Organic listings and listicles.

Retargeting is a strategy to track your potential customers across multiple online platforms. One way to do this is to have cookies on your product's website that can show relevant advertisements on Facebook or other apps when the user visits those sites/apps.
