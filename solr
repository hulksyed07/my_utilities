Using create command

Using create_core command

Creating Solr Core
Using Create Command: A schema-less core can be created by using the Create Command. This can be created by executing the following command.

sudo su - solr -c "/opt/solr/bin/solr create  -c <core_name> -n data_driven_schema_configs"
Example:

sudo su - solr -c "/opt/solr/bin/solr create  -c mycollection -n data_driven_schema_configs"
Using create_core command: The create_core command has the following options.

-c core_name: describes the name of the core that you want to create

-p port_name: port at which you want to create a core

-d conf_dir: configuration directory of the port

Syntax:

sudo su - solr -c "/opt/solr/bin/solr create_core  -c <core_name> -n data_driven_schema_configs"


Deleting Solr Core
You can also delete the cores, that is created earlier.

First you need to go to bin directory and then execute the following command.

 ./solr delete -c <core_name>
For example, if you want to delete the core with a name my_solrcore, out of the two cores my_solrcore and my_solrcore1, you need to execute the below command.
