union
select 'wellow' as name, null as val from dual

) order by val
fetch first 50 percent rows only
--fetch first 3 rows only
--offset 1 rows fetch next 3 rows only
--offset 2 rows fetch 50 percent rows only
--fetch first 2 rows wth ties;

-- in case  of offset with percentage percentage will be calculated on master set and not after the offset
-- in case of fetch n rows with ties in order by val it will fetch n+1 or n+2 records in case two records have same values


--Substitution variables
-- use single ampersand to use value on run time and delete the variable after use:

select * from (
select 'hello' as name, null as val from dual
union
select 'yelow' as name, 20 as val from dual
) where name = '&nam'
-- val = &val;
--This will give a prompt on SQL developer and you need to enter the value of &nam
--Use single quote for string values
--Dont use single quote for numeric values
--you can ue multiple substitution variables too like shown below:

select name, &col_name from (
select 'hello' as name, null as val from dual
union
select 'yelow' as name, 20 as val from dual
union
select 'wellow' as name, null as val from dual
union
select 'zello' as name, 50 as val from dual
) where &where_clause
Order by &order_clause;

you can enter the below values in prompt:
&col_name: val
&where_clause: name = 'hello'
&order_clause: name DESC

--To avoid manually inserting this value again and again you can set this value in Define which would be valid for that whole session

DEFINE nam='hello';

select * from (
select 'hello' as name, null as val from dual
union
select 'yelow' as name, 20 as val from dual
union
select 'wellow' as name, null as val from dual
union
select 'zello' as name, 50 as val from dual
) where name = '&nam';

UNDEFINE nam;

--To change the prompt message you can use the below way, variable will persist for the session:
ACCEPT NAM PROMPT 'Please enter the name of user';

select * from (
select 'hello' as name, null as val from dual
union
select 'yelow' as name, 20 as val from dual
) where name = '&nam';

UNDEFINE nam;


-- If you define a variable using && then it will persist for the whole session and will not ask for its value again and again
select * from (
select 'hello' as name, null as val from dual
union
select 'yelow' as name, 20 as val from dual
) where name = '&&nam';

UNDEFINE nam;
--so it assigns and defines at the same time when user is prompted for input;
-- If using double ampersand followed by single ampersand for same variable in same query then the value
will be directly transferred to the single ampersand

select &&col_name from (
select 'hello' as name, null as val from dual
union
select 'yelow' as name, 20 as val from dual
) ORDER by &col_name;
