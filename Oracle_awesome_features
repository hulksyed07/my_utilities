fetch first 50 percent rows only
--fetch first 3 rows only
--offset 1 rows fetch next 3 rows only
--offset 2 rows fetch 50 percent rows only
--fetch first 2 rows wth ties;

-- in case  of offset with percentage percentage will be calculated on master set and not after the offset
-- in case of fetch n rows with ties in order by val it will fetch n+1 or n+2 records in case two records have same values
