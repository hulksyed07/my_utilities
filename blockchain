Ethereum

Permissionless and generic Blockchain platform
Governed by Ethereum developers
Mining based on Proof of Work (POW)
Consensus approached at Ledger level

Smart contract is a software that controls the movement of digital assets amongst parties based on certain rules of negotiation.

Key features:
Elimination of a third party intervention
Traceable and Irreversible transactions
Self Executing and Self Enforcing
Smart contract in Bitcoin validates transaction only if certain predefined conditions are met whereas ''Ethereum'' allows developers to program their own smart contracts.

Hyperledger

Modular and permissioned platform
Governed by Linux foundation
Multiple consensus approaches - at transaction level

Introduced by Linux foundation, Hyperledger is an open source, modular architecture targeted at businesses that aim to streamline their process leveraging blockchain technology.

Etherum vs Hyperledger:
As Ethereum is an open and distributed platform where it is impossible to hide a transaction from anyone, on the other hand, hyperledger gives this flexibility.

R3 Corda

Specialized distributed and permissioned ledger platform
Governed by R3
Specific consensus at transaction level

R3 Corda has a unique approach to data distribution where the data is shared only between the genuine participants.

This concept makes Corda popularly known as a DLT that refers to Distributed ledger technology with a difference.

Financial service industry could best leverage this distinct feature of Corda.
